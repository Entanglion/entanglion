# Entanglion Expansions
We encourage Entanglion players to create their own expansions of the Entanglion game universe. If you have developed an expansion, we would be happy to list it here!

To have your expansion listed, please open an issue with the "enhancement" label and give us a description of your game expansion and a link to your github repository. We will review it and list it here.

## Guidance on expanding Entanglion
Creating an expansion to Entanglion can be a fun, challenging, and rewarding experience. We would like to offer a few suggestions to make the process go smoothly.

1. Many elements of the game can be changed, but the hardest element to change is the game board. Specifically, the map of the quantum universe was developed to accurately reflect the different kinds of quantum states that can be achieved using the combination of H, X, CNOT, and SWAP cards. Although there are other kinds of quantum gates than just these, it might be difficult to accurately model the quantum states achievable from them.
2. Any new elements added to the game (e.g. additional pieces, new cards, new boards) should be easily printable. Test your designs on black and white printers as well as color printers. We recommend providing new game elements as PDF documents for easy portability.
3. Keep in mind that some players may be color blind. Test your colors using a color blindness simulator such as [Sim Daltonism](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/).
